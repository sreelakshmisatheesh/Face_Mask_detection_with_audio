# Face Mask Detection

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

This work is a modification of the [FaceMaskDetector](https://github.com/Karan-Malik/FaceMaskDetector) repository. It aims to detect face masks and provide voice instructions using a reference implementation.

## Overview

The Face Mask Detection project utilizes computer vision techniques to identify whether individuals are wearing masks or not. It's built upon a pre-trained deep learning model that can classify images into "with mask" or "without mask" categories. This forked repository enhances the project by integrating a voice generator that provides verbal instructions to individuals based on mask detection results.

## Features

- Detects face masks in images or real-time video streams.
- Provides voice instructions using synthesized speech.
- Utilizes transfer learning for efficient model training.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
